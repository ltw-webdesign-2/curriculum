      ## What & why

      When learning to write HTML, you have to start thinking about content differently—about its purpose and meaning.

      Using some pre-written content we’ll go through, learn & discuss how & why choose HTML tags.

      **With some practice, and some memorization, we can grasp what content HTML describes.**
